# Exploratory Data Analysis

### **1.** How Does Exploratory Data Analysis differ from Classical Data Analysis?

EDA is a data analysis approach. What other data analysis approaches exist and how does EDA differ from these other approaches? Three popular data analysis approaches are :

1. Classical
2. EDA
3. Bayesian

For classical analysis, the sequence is :

**Problem =&gt; Data =&gt; Model =&gt; Analysis =&gt; Conclusions**

For EDA, the sequence is

 **Problem =&gt; Data =&gt; Analysis =&gt; Model =&gt; Conclusions**

For Bayesian, the sequence is 

**Problem =&gt; Data =&gt; Model =&gt; Prior Distribution =&gt; Analysis =&gt; Conclusions**

### Model Selection: 

 The classical approach imposes models \(both deterministic and probabilistic\) on the data. Deterministic models include, for example, [regression models](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmd/section1/pmd141.htm) and [analysis of variance \(ANOVA\)](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda355.htm) models. The most common probabilistic model assumes that the errors about the deterministic model are normally distributed--this assumption affects the validity of the ANOVA F tests.

The Exploratory Data Analysis approach does not impose deterministic or probabilistic models on the data. On the contrary, the EDA approach allows the data to suggest admissible models that best fit the data.

### Techniques :

 Classical techniques are generally [quantitative](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35.htm) in nature. They include [ANOVA](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section4/prc42.htm), [t tests](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda353.htm), [chi-squared tests](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda358.htm), and [F tests](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda359.htm)

 EDA techniques are generally [graphical](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda33.htm). They include [scatter plots, character plots](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/scatterp.htm), [box plots](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/boxplot.htm), [histograms](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/histogra.htm), [bihistograms](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/bihistog.htm), [probability plots](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/probplot.htm), [residual plots](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/6plot.htm), and [mean plots](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/meanplot.htm).
